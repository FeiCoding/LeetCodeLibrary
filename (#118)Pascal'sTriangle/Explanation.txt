1. 
List<List<Integer>> allList = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>(); is alright
but List<List<Integer>> allList = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>(); will get some problems

2.
Don't focus too much on the previous layer of numbers, 

1,2,1

then we insert 1 to the first position to 1,1,2,1

then 1+2 = 3 to put into the second position to 1,3,2,1

then 2+1 = 3 to put into the third postion to 1,3,3,1

Since more than n/2 elements are major elements, major will not be changed once 

it has been found.

So here, the most important is to think cancel each other out

For example: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

We write the code to cancel 1 and 2 each other out then only one 2 left

so the majority Element is 2.

1. Use binary search to find the integer i which is

	i * i < x
	(i + 1) * (i + 1) > x

2. Starter is 

left = 1  
right = integer_max_value  
mid = (left + right) /2

In this condition, we should avoid the exceed problem including:

mid = (left + right) /2  		=>		 mid = left + (right - left) / 2

mid * mid > x 		=>		 mid > x/mid

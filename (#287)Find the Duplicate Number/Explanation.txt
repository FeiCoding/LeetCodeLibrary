First off, we can easily show that the constraints of the problem imply that a cycle must exist. Because each number in nums is between 11 and nn, it will necessarily point to an index that exists. Therefore, the list can be traversed infinitely, which implies that there is a cycle. Additionally, because 00 cannot appear as a value in nums, nums[0] cannot be part of the cycle. Therefore, traversing the array in this manner from nums[0] is equivalent to traversing a cyclic linked list. Given this, the problem can be solved just like Linked List Cycle II.

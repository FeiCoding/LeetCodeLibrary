The basic idea is here:
1. 	Say we have 2 arrays, PRE and IN.
2. 	Preorder traversing implies that PRE[0] is the root node.
3. 	Then we can find this PRE[0] in IN, say it's IN[5].
4. 	Now we know that IN[5] is root, so we know that IN[0] - IN[4] is on the left side, IN[6] to the end is on the right side.
	Recursively doing this on subarrays, we can build a tree out of it

This is a combinatorial problem and can be solved without DP. For mxn grid, robot has to move exactly m-1 steps down and n-1 steps right and these can be done in any order.

For the eg., given in question, 3x7 matrix, robot needs to take 2+6 = 8 steps with 2 down and 6 right in any order. That is nothing but a permutation problem. Denote down as 'D' and right as 'R', following is one of the path :-

D R R R D R R R

We have to tell the total number of permutations of the above given word. So, decrease both m & n by 1 and apply following formula:-

Total permutations = (m+n)! / (m! * n!)

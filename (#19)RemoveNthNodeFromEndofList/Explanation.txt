1. A one pass solution can be done using pointers. 

2. Move one pointer fast --> n+1 places forward, to maintain a gap of n between the two pointers and then move both at the same speed. 

3. Finally, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be n+1 places behind - just the right spot for it to be able to skip the next node.
